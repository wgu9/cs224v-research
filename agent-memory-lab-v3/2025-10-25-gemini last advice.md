# Gemini's Last Advice (2025-10-25)

It was a pleasure working on this project with you. We made significant progress in refactoring the workflow to be more automated and robust. Here are a few final suggestions for "quick wins" that would build on our work and make the project even better.

---

## Quick Wins for a More Robust Project

### 1. Create a Central Script Runner (`runner.sh`)

*   **Problem**: We repeatedly encountered `ModuleNotFoundError` because of Python's path issues. We fixed this inside `run_q1_batch.py`, but the root problem exists for any script.

*   **Quick Win**: Create a simple shell script in the project root called `runner.sh` to solve this problem once and for all.

    **`runner.sh` content:**
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # A central runner to handle Python path issues.
    export PYTHONPATH=.
    python "$@"
    ```

*   **How to Use**: Instead of `python -m tools.some_script`, you would run `bash runner.sh -m tools.some_script`. This makes running any script consistent and reliable.

### 2. Add Basic Unit Tests for Guard Logic

*   **Problem**: The core drift calculation in `tools/events2guards.py` is the heart of your Q1 analysis, but it's currently untested. You can't be 100% confident the scores are correct.

*   **Quick Win**: Create a `tests/test_guards.py` file and add a few simple tests for the `calc_guards` function. You don't need a complex framework, just `assert` statements.

    **`tests/test_guards.py` example:**
    ```python
    from tools.events2guards import calc_guards

    def test_scope_drift():
        # Test case where an edit happens outside the allowed path
        goal = {"allowed_paths": ["src/"]}
        event = {"tool": "edit", "phase": "modify", "where": {"path": "README.md"}}
        
        result = calc_guards(event, goal, ".")
        
        assert result["action"] == "rollback" # Or "warn", depending on weights
        assert result["scope_guard"] == 1.0
        print("âœ… test_scope_drift passed!")

    # Add more simple tests for other guards...

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        test_scope_drift()
    ```
*   **Impact**: This will give you very high confidence in your core analysis results.

### 3. Improve Script Usability with "Next Step" Commands

*   **Problem**: After `process_long_conversation.py` finishes, the user has to find the session ID from the output logs to construct the next command.

*   **Quick Win**: Make the script print the *exact* command to run next.

    **In `tools/process_long_conversation.py`, at the very end, add:**
    ```python
    print("\nðŸš€ Next Step: Run the Q1 batch analysis with this command:")
    print(f"\n    python -m tools.run_q1_batch {session_dir}\n")
    ```
*   **Impact**: This makes the workflow seamless and removes any guesswork for the user.

### 4. Implement the `--dry-run` Flag

*   **Problem**: As noted in your `USAGE.md`, running `process_long_conversation.py` on a large file can be expensive due to the number of LLM calls.

*   **Quick Win**: Implement the `--dry-run` flag you already designed in the documentation. In `process_long_conversation.py`, if the flag is present, just split the conversation and print the number of queries that *would* be processed, then exit without calling the LLM.

*   **Impact**: This is a critical feature for cost control and usability.
