  "project_context_llm": "A technical documentation and implementation alignment project for a 'Chat-first' pipeline that enables intelligent programming agents to support cross-session learning, execution monitoring, and dynamic abstraction. The project involves updating and aligning documentation, schemas, and scripts to reflect the latest v3 implementation, focusing on event extraction from chat logs, guard evaluation, pattern card extraction, and user-adaptive view rendering.",
  "overall_objective_llm": "To ensure that all documentation, code skeletons, and interface definitions for the intelligent programming agent system are fully aligned with the current v3 implementation. This includes updating schemas, clarifying the distinction between planned and applied changes, standardizing tool and script names, and providing clear, accurate, and maintainable technical documentation (including Chinese translations of key files) to support rapid team adoption and future development.",
