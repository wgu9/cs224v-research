Subject: Next Steps - Focusing on Q1 Context Drift Detection

Hi Yucheng,

Thank you for yesterday's meeting - very helpful direction! I really appreciate you taking the time to clarify the scope and methodology.

To confirm my understanding of the next steps:

1. **Focus on Q1 only (Context Drift Detection)** - Pausing Q2 (Cross-session memory) for this quarter
2. **Start with literature survey & formal definition** - No coding yet, as you emphasized this is the foundation
3. **Generalize to 3 benchmarks**: SWE-bench, Tau Bench, and Web Arena
4. **Use existing trajectories** - Not running expensive experiments, will use published trajectories from S3/public sources
5. **Iterate with you at each step** - Send for review after each milestone on Slack

My Week 1 plan:
- Day 1-2 (Oct 29-30): Literature survey (read your recommended papers + find 5-10 more)
- Day 3-4 (Oct 31-Nov 1): Write formal Context Drift definition with justified dimensions
- Day 5-7 (Nov 2-5): Research Tau Bench and Web Arena, create benchmark comparison

I'll send you the literature survey document by Wednesday (Oct 30) for review, then proceed to the formal definition.

Key focus areas based on your feedback:
- **Repetitive Mistakes** dimension (you emphasized this is especially evident in Tau Bench and Web Arena)
- Using Model Cards methodology to justify each dimension
- Ensuring generalizability across different task types

Questions:
1. For the Model Cards paper you mentioned - could you share the PDF or send me the title/authors so I can find it?
2. Are there any other specific papers you'd recommend on context/goal drift?

Thank you again for the guidance. Looking forward to your feedback on the literature survey!

Best,
Jeremy

## Quick Slack Message (Alternative)

If you prefer to send a quick Slack message first:

```
Hi Yucheng,

Thanks again for yesterday's meeting! Very clear direction.

Quick confirmation - focusing on Q1 (Context Drift Detection) this quarter:
✅ Week 1: Literature survey → Formal definition → Benchmark comparison
✅ Using existing trajectories (not running expensive experiments)
✅ Generalizing to 3 benchmarks (SWE-bench, Tau Bench, Web Arena)
✅ Will iterate with you at each step

Starting literature survey today - will send you the doc by Wednesday for review.

Two quick questions:
1. Could you share the Model Cards paper (title/PDF)?
2. Any other recommended papers on context/goal drift?

Thanks!
Jeremy

## When to Send

**Best time**: Today (Oct 29), as soon as possible

**Why**:
- Shows you're proactive
- Confirms you understood the direction
- Gets you the Model Cards paper reference
- Opens communication channel for Week 1

## After Sending

1. Wait for Yucheng's confirmation
2. Start reading the 3 papers he recommended:
   - Agent Trajectory Dataset: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02820
   - Auto-Metrics Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07971
   - Model Cards Paper: (wait for his response)

3. Begin literature survey while waiting for reply
